- 👋 Hi, I’m @simonsclz
- 👀 I’m interested in (theoretical) computer science, machine learning, data science, programming and sports.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying data science at TU Chemnitz (Chemnitz University of Technology) and received my bachelor's degree in computer science in 2021.
- 🗺️ I love going on vacation. My favourite destination is Hydra/Ύδρα, a small Greek island. My profile picture was taken there.
